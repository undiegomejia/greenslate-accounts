# Welcome 

On this Code Challenge, my task was to redesign an Account Dashboard to test my abilities in HTML, CSS, UX Design and UI Design.
I started using the platform on how it was, and I noticed a lot of things that should have to be redesigned. In my process I started thinking more about how I can improve the way that every action was told by the user.
So I thought the best way was to think more about components and try to reach a more atomic design way of doing this project.
## The components
So I started doing wireframes and listing the following components:
* **The Header:** In here we will have the main title as well as some options buttons that have: Currency, Location and Date. This header will be displayed fixed in mobile for better user experience.
* **The Totals Report:** This component will show the total reports of all accounts, as a main information for the user this will be shown at the beginning of the application.
* **The Account List:** this would be the list of accounts the are available, there will be a pagination since this list can be very large. This list will have settings that will give to the user the possibility to sort the information, or just show relevant info.
* **The Account Info:** This section will be showing details of the inner account, such as sub accounts, movements and description.

## The process
I started by writing the list of elements and components as I show. Later on I create wireframes to have a general idea on how my design will be displayed. After this, I create a Figma file using Material Design Icons to help me get a better UX.
